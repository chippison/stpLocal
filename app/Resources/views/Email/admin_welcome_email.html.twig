    Welcome to the Teaching and School Practices Survey Tool.

<p>
   This survey tool has been developed by NZCER to provide useful information for school inquiry, review, and development. The questions in the surveys come out of robust research on effective teaching and school practices and effective principal leadership.
</p>

    We hope you have been able to provide your teaching staff with the initial information they require for getting themselves logged onto the survey site (see email with subject TSP Administrator instructions for Teacher Survey).
